## Requirements

A recent and currently supported version of Python (right now, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Python supports versions 3.10 and above</a>).

As **Ormdantic** is based on **Pydantic** and **SQLAlchemy** and **Pypika**, it requires them. They will be automatically installed when you install Ormdantic.
