## Developing

If you already cloned the repository and you know that you need to deep dive
into the code, here is a guideline to set up your environment:

### Virtual environment with `uv`

You can create a virtual environment in a directory using Python's [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
module:

<div class="termy">

```console
pip install uv

uv venv
```

</div>

That will create a directory `.venv` with the python binaries and then you will
be able to install packages for that isolated environment.

### Activate the environment

Activate the new environment with:

=== "Linux, macOS"

    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ source ./.venv/bin/activate
    ```

    </div>

=== "Windows PowerShell"

    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

    </div>

=== "Windows Bash"

    Or if you use Bash for Windows (e.g. <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Git Bash</a>):

    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ source ./.venv/Scripts/activate
    ```

    </div>

To check it worked, use:

=== "Linux, macOS, Windows Bash"

    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ which pip
    ```

    </div>

=== "Windows PowerShell"

    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ Get-Command pip
    ```

    </div>

If it shows the `pip` binary at `venv/bin/pip` then it worked. ðŸŽ‰

!!! tip

    Every time you install a new package with `pip` under that environment,
    activate the environment again.

    This makes sure that if you use a terminal program installed by that package (like `pre-commit`), you use the one from your local environment and not any other that could be installed globally.

### pip

After activating the environment as described above, Now lets install all the package that you need to develop ormdantic:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ uv pip install -r requirements/all.txt

---> 100%
```

</div>

It will install all the dependencies in your local environment.

#### Including

The Dependencies file contains all the dependencies that you need to develop
ormdantic, which are:

- The Base Dependencies - the ones that are needed to run ormdantic.
  [See Installation](../installation.md).

### Format

For Providing a good and consistent experience, we recommend using
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) - a tool that runs a set of checks before
you commit your code.

#### Git Hooks

First you need to install the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool, which
is installed before with the Dev Dependencies.

Now, install the pre-commit hooks in your `.git/hooks/` directory:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pre-commit install
```

</div>

This one will provide a linting check before you commit your code.

#### Including

The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` contains the following configuration with the
linting packages.

- `pre-commit-hooks` - Some out-of-the-box hooks for pre-commit.
- `ruff-pre-commit` - A tool to check Python code for errors.

## Documentation

First, make sure you set up your environment as described above, that will
install all the requirements.

The documentation uses
<a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">MkDocs</a>.

All the documentation is in Markdown format in the directory `./docs`.

### Including

To Build ormdantic Documentation we need the following packages, which are:

- `mkdocs` - The tool that builds the documentation.
- `mkdocs-material` - The theme that ormdantic uses.
- `mkdocs-markdownextradata-plugin` - The plugin that allows to add extra data
  to the documentation.

## Testing

all the dependencies that you need to test ormdantic, which are:

### Including

- `pytest` - The tool that runs the tests.
- `pytest-asyncio` - The plugin that runs the tests in the background.

and other dependencies that are needed to run the tests.

### Generate a Test Report

As we know, the tests are very important to make sure that ormdantic works as
expected, that why i provide a multi test for and functions to provide a good
test.

If you want to generate the test report:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ bash scripts/test.sh
```

</div>
